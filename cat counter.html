    <p>Warning: Highly annoying. For your own health and safety 
        please prepare a microwave to stick your head in after 
        using this program, or better yet, an oven if you can afford it. 
        If not, I recommend you use this underwater to at least prevent 
        anyone near you from suffering this monstrosity of a program I have created.
        Please also make sure that you are on the ground floor to prevent any accidents. I am 
        not responsible for any damage to your mental health, relationships, property, sense of happiness etc. 
        You have been warned, please take the appropriate precautions.</p>
        <p>Cheers.</p>
        <p>Enjoy.</p>
